# Explainability model for Rawnet

Designed to work with the [Rawnet baseline system](https://github.com/asvspoof-challenge/2021)
from the ASVspoof challenge 2021. It is a black-box model that detects whether
audio clips are real or fake - where *fake* refers to a 'deepfake' audio clip.

To use you have to have a trained Rawnet model e.g *trained_model.pth*
